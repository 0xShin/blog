1. When hunting for a bug always try to understand what the application does first and try to focus on the bugs that are common to be found  depending on the functionality of the application.
2. Start to alter your thinking to be less about a technical bug class, and more about an impact. Think "as an attacker I would.." and less "I must test for XYZ". If you report around that mindset you'll identify new areas to attack in business logic, and write better reports. - Michael Skelton
3. The best hacking tool is your brain. Train it! :D - m0z
