DC-2 is a purposely built vulnerable lab for the purpose of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing. Please do not forget to set up your hostname for dc-2, you can do this by editing `/etc/hosts` and inserting the IP of your machine then dc-2. `IP	dc-2`

### Website 80-TCP
Upon visiting the site, we are greeted by a wordpress-type of a site and it seems that one of the tab in the navigation bar is the FLAG.

Hmmm, it looks like its hinting us to use a tool called `cewl`.
Technically, Cewl is a tool that is used to generate wordlists by going through the site you have given it to visit which means it makes a list of possible usernames,passwords and etc.

using the command `cewl http://dc-2 -w wordlist.txt` it generated a file that contains words, because of the hint in the FLAG 1 I think we need to bruteforce for credentials.

We can bruteforce wordpress credentials by using `wpscan` a tool use for enumerating wordpress and its components it also supports credential bruteforcing.

To bruteforce for the credentials use `wpscan --url URL -P wordlist.txt` and wait for a while.
```
[!] Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: jerry, Password: adipiscing
 | Username: tom, Password: parturient
```
 
 ### User
 To get our initial foothold let's login to the wordpress portal first by visiting `http://dc-2/wp-admin/`.
 
 Looking around the site it seems that we can't find a way to gain foothold here but alas we have found another FLAG in the pages tab.

Hmmmm, another hint huh? it looks like its telling us that there's another way to get in but our nmap scan only has PORT 80 on it. This time let's do a full tcp nmap scan.

![full-tcp.png](/blog/assets/images/DC-2/73ef46075b234daab26526252eabd888.png)
Ahoy! it looks like we have another port which is `7744` let's try to figure out what service is running under that port by doing `nc dc-2 7744`. BOOM! we got ourselves a OPENSSH Port maybe this is the entry point that the FLAG 2 was trying to say.

Logging in with tom and his credentials we are in but unfortunately we are in a restricted environment :( fortunately there's still a way for us to get out of this restricted environment, by using `vi` and writing `:set shell=/bin/bash` and `:shell` we can get out of the place.

#### BROOKEN COOOMANDS EVERYWHERE
```
tom@DC-2:~$ id
bash: id: command not found
```
We can fix this, I know we can by setting 
```
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```
#### Root

Reading flag3 and again it is hinting us what to do next like the previous flags and right now it seems it is hinting us to change our user to Jerry and we shall do it!

Checking our permissions using `sudo -l` we now find that we can run `git` as root and by using our friendly neighborhood [spiderman](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/git/).

We can root the machine  through using 
```
sudo git branch --help config
!/bin/sh
```
```
# whoami
root
# cat final-flag.txt
