## Website - Port 80 TCP
When we open the website, we can see that we are greeted by a CMS called Drupal, searching up searchsploit and google shows that there's a multiple exploits in drupal that allows us to get a code execution, comparing the version of the drupal that is installed in the website and the version affected by the exploits they are the same.

## User 
To get our initial foothold we will be using the msfconsole drupalgeddon's module if you take a look at the picture below, we are getting a shell because drupal is vulnerable.

## Root
After numerous [commands](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) to gather data.
`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` shows us that there's a unusual binary that has a [SUID](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/what-is-suid-sgid-and-sticky-bit/) bit which allows us to use that command as a super user or root so when I saw this I quickly read its manual if there's anything we can use to escalate us or execute command, which there is it's called `-exec`. 
There are conditions when using this command, firstly, in the end we need to put `\;` which escapes `;` and marks it the end of the `-exec` argument. We can also use `{}` in the argument and it resembles the current file being processed and we shouldn't forget to put `-quit` so that it won't loop. Knowing these we can use `find /root` first to check the files that are inside of the `/root` directory and after that you can use this command `find /root/FLAGNAME.txt -exec cat "{}" \; -quit` to read the flag.
